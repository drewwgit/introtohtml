        <p style="font-size: x-large;"> Our uniqueness, our individuality, and our life experience molds us into fascinating beings. I hope we can embrace that. I pray we may all challenge ourselves to delve into the deepest resources of our hearts to cultivate an atmosphere of understanding, acceptance, tolerance, and compassion. We are all in this life together. <h2>

        <h1> Enzo the Dog </h1>
        <p>I wake up and think about playing with my dog. Dogs are special because they bring about happiness and unconditional love on an every day basis. We're not sure exactly what Enzo's breed is, but he's somewhere between a Schnoodle mix. He loves to play with toys, get treats and go on walks. Even though he likes to pull on the leash</p>

        <h1> Muay Thai </h1>
        <p>Being a mix of both aerobic and anaerobic workout, Muay Thai is a type of martial art that offers both strength and endurance. On the one hand, you undergo running, jumping rope and shadowboxing, which gives you a dash of aerobic activity. Whereas on the other hand, you train yourself for anaerobic exercises like punching, kicking, elbowing, and kneeing.
        The aerobic element helps increase the overall cardiovascular performance of the body. This develops stamina and strength that is required for the optimal functioning of the human body</p>

        <h1>Piano </h1>
        <p>Piano practice also boosts cognitive and intellectual abilities, which is to say it makes you smarter and activates similar parts of the brain used in spatial reasoning and math. Studying piano has also been shown to amazingly improve memory — particularly verbal memory — and build good habits like focus and perseverance, diligence and creativity. Children who had a few years of piano study under their belts could remember twenty percent more vocabulary words than their peers. And childhood musicians are better equipped later in life to retain information from speeches and lectures. Playing piano has been shown to increase spatial-temporal ability, which figures heavily in math, science and engineering. Regular music practice at an early age can even make structural changes to the brain that stay with you for the rest of your life, making your brain more efficient both while playing and in extra-musical endeavors.</p>
